    //Recursive algorithm for initializing any number of subpages:

    //Find menu page name from the id

    //Find number of subpages
    //Init this page with name and overpage pointing to the overpage parameter
    
    //If overpage != NULL
        //Enter overpage
        //Init a MenuItem with this page you just inited and name 
        //Add this item to the list and increment the numItems of the overpage
        //Exit overpage

    //Iterate over all subpages
        //If any underpages:
            //Call this function again, with this page as overpage parameter, without assigning to anything
        //If not any subpages:
            //return this page (this will eventually return the pointer to the main menu page)
